*Batch converter for Windows using Inkscape with the command line*  
InkscapeBatchConvert is an easy to use solution to quickly convert all files of a folder to another type without the need to open Inkscape. The program uses Windows Batch scripting and will only work on Windows.  
Tested with Inkscape 0.9.x - 1.3.x âœ…

## Usage
1. Download `_InkscapeBatchConvert.bat`
2. Put it in the folder where you have files you wish to convert.
3. Then double click the file to start it.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                                                      | Solution                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Windows blocks the program                                   | `Right click the file â†’ Properties â†’ Unblock`                |

| I can't convert EPS / PDF files. The program says it runs the conversion, but there are no files in the out folder. | Make sure you have ghost script installed and added to your environment path. For more information read the [Inkscape FAQ](https://inkscape.org/learn/faq/#how-open-eps-files-windows) |

| Can't find Inkscape installation                             | All common file paths are checked for the installation. If you haven't installed Inkscape download it [here](https://inkscape.org/download), otherwise you can also define your own path in the script by adding the next array element of `inkscapePaths` to the script |

| I'm missing a setting in the script, e.g. defined output width | Have a look at the [Commandline Documentation](https://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Using_the_Command_Line) or read the inkscape help file `inkscape --help` and add the needed properties to the script |

| I'm missing a specific input or output type                  | If inkscape supports those types, you can easily add them to the list in the script (search for `validInput` and `validOutput`) |

## Todo

Use shell or pipe to avoid starting inkscape for every file as pointed out by @vaifrax [here](https://gist.github.com/JohannesDeml/779b29128cdd7f216ab5000466404f11#gistcomment-2697671). I would be very happy to get help for that ðŸ™‚
